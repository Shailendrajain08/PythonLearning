# In python, taking user input is possible by using input() funtion. This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable. input function always consider as string if you want to use it for float, number or other data types you have to typeCast. 

# a = input("Enter Your Name: ")

# print("My Name is:", a)

x = input('Enter First number: ')
y = input('Enter Second number: ')

print (x + y)                          #it will concatinate
print (int(x) + int(y))
